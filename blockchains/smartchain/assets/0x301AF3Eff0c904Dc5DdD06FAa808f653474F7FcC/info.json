    "description": "Unbound Finance is a decentralized, cross-chain lending protocol that enables DeFi users to borrow over-collateralized synthetic asset loans by pledging their idle interest-bearing tokens (ib tokens) at a 0% interest rate. Unbound also allows the collateralization of Uniswap v3 positions. While being collateralized, the tokens will continue to accrue transaction fees from liquidity provisioning to the underlying pool. Borrowed funds can be used to lend, borrow, trade, or even acquire more ib tokens to gain additional returns on the same initial capital. ",
